# Project - Part I

We are going to implement an online store. <br>
The first step will be to create a [CPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPF_number) validator

## Tests

1. Shouldn't create an order if the CPF is invalid
2. Should create an order correctly (with description, price, and quantity)
3. Should apply a discount coupon correctly (reducing the order price)
